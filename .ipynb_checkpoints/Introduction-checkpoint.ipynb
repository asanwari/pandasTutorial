    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is inteneded as a learning tool for fellow data scientists and data science enthusiasts. In this notebook, I will be talking about the pandas library. The material here is going to be taken from several sources. I will try my best to cite all used sources and give credit where due.\n",

    "## What is pandas?\n",
    "pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,\n",
    "built on top of the Python programming language. (https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n",
    "\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Although I will start  from the very basic ideas, the reader is expected to have a fairly decent understanding of python. Afterall, this is a library built on python.\n",

    "I really like to learn the basic data structure of anything new. This allows us to view the functionality and the operations from the perspective of the developers who wrote the library. Without a strong understanding of data structures, using pandas would require frequent \"googling\" (not saying that after understanding it you would be completely independent of google!). \n",
    "\n",
    "I guess the point here is that once we see how the data is handled from the prespective of the library, things make way more sense and it sort of becomes intuitive to work with it. Enough mumbling! Let's get on with it!\n",
